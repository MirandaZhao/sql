-- 子查询实现
select year, sale,
       case when sale = (select sale from Sales s2 where s2.year = s1.year - 1) then '->'
       when sale > (select sale from Sales s2 where s2.year = s1.year - 1) then '>'
       when sale < (select sale from Sales s2 where s2.year = s1.year - 1) then '<'
       else '-' END as var

-- 自连接实现
select s1.year, s1.sale,

-- 将上面两个结果的年份和var转换成横着展示的
